## Notes
- Removes icons from other players. You will still have your icon... Still trying to fix that.
- Alternative solution is to modify the graphics in the gpk. The [Remove Artisan Icons (UI Mod)](https://github.com/teralove/remove-artisan-icons) does just that. That UI mod and this script are both trying to accomplish the samething, but by different means. Preferably, I would use this script but there's that one bug (You still have icon).
